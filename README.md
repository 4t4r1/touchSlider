Features
========
Three possible options for animation:

* Automatic (3D CSS transition is used if detected)
* JavaScript (jQuery methods will be used for animation)
* No Animation (slider will work with no animation, useful for browsers with poor support of JavaScript like BlackBerry OS 5)

Three sliding modes:

* Fixed value scrolling. The value can be set in pixels or has percentage value relative to the available width.
* Per item scrolling.
* Automatic mode. When it automatically detects how many items can be placed within the available width. See example below.

Using callback functions you may build custom designed controls like 

* Previous/next slide 
* Navigate to particular slide by index
* Display current slide index 
* and so on ...
